Hi my friends, following the moment subject I going to write a little about reactive programming

In computing, reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. (wikipedia)

first point, the reactive programming is a paradigm like OO, imperative and functional are also

studying about paradigm the simple way to understand this approach is:

When I have a formula on cell C1 in spreadsheet ex.: ´=A1+B1´, and then when I change cell value, C1 cell show the sum of values 

In imperative programming we push and in reactive we take the data, it is the main difference amoung them  

## Benefits

#### Flexibility
#### Scalable
#### More tolerance of failure
#### Flexibility


## The Four Principles according the reactive manifesto

#### Responsive
#### Elastic, Resilient
#### Message Driven 

its is a brief summary about the reactive programming concept

It's just for today, bye !!!
